# **Movie Data Analysis**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on the analysis of movie data. By scraping, cleaning, exploring, and performing regression analysis on various attributes such as movie ratings, box office performance, and other factors, this analysis aims to uncover insights into movie trends and performance predictors.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Collection**: Scraped data from a movie database using the `movies.py` script.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed and cleaned the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
- **Regression Analysis**: Utilized **Seaborn** and **scikit-learn** to perform linear regression analysis and evaluate the model's performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations such as scatter plots with regression lines to illustrate relationships between variables.
- **Insights Generation**: Derived actionable insights and conclusions based on the analysis results.

## **Usage**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TanishTaneja/Analyzing-Movies-Revenue.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Analyzing-Movies-Revenue`
3. Run the data scraping script: `python movies.py`
4. Review the data cleaning and EDA scripts to understand the steps followed in the analysis.
5. Execute the regression analysis scripts using **Seaborn** and **scikit-learn** to reproduce the analysis or explore the data interactively.
6. Refer to the generated visualizations and analysis insights for further understanding.

## **Data Sources**

- **Movie Database**: Data scraped using the `movies.py` script from a specified movie database.

## **Dependencies**

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## **Conclusion**

Analyzing movie data provides valuable insights into the film industry, performance predictors, and market trends. By leveraging the collected data and conducting thorough analysis, this project aims to inform decision-making processes for filmmakers, producers, and stakeholders in the movie industry.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding new analysis techniques, visualizations, or expanding the dataset to explore additional insights.
